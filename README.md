# cpp-c
a collection of problems and examples I solved during my first semester in uni using cpp
During my first semester of learning C++ and C, I coded a collection of programs that I am proud of. Some of my favorite projects include a simple calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations, a program that calculates the area of a circle based on user input, and a game of hangman that I created from scratch. While these programs may seem small and simple, they taught me valuable lessons about programming and helped me improve my skills. I am excited to continue learning and creating more complex programs in the future.
